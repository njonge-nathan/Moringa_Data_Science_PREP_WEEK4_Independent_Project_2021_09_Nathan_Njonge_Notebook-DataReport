# Description
Car-sharing is a model of car rental where people rent cars for short periods, often by the hour. It differs from traditional car rental in that the owners of the cars are often private individuals themselves, and the car-sharing facilitator is generally distinct from the car owner. Car-sharing is part of the larger trend of shared mobility.
As car-sharing continues to influence how we get from point A to B in our communities, electric car-sharing could help accelerate our transition to cleaner vehicles as they work to meet their climate goals and reduce their carbon footprint.
# Objective
The main objective of this research is to identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the 9 days in April 2018.
# Recommendation/Conclusion
The most popular hour for pickup is 03:00 am and the most popular hour of return is 10:00 pm. It is also seen that most pickups occur during the weekdays. More cars should be made available during working hours.  The most frequented station is 8 Avenue De la Porte de Montrouge. There shouldnâ€™t lack cars at this station at any given time
